What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    git creates a directory .git, where I decided to start.
    Next I have to choose which file to add in the staging area and next to commit

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    It helps to organize better the commits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    If my changes affects more than one file, I can add them all and commit it.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
    When creating different versions of the entire work
